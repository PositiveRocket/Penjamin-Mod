## FAQ

You can load Penjamin by itself, but you‚Äôll need **Smokeleaf Industries** to make extracts and infuse carts.

**How many uses do I get?**

**How do I recharge?**  
Right-click a **Redstone Block** with the pen/battery.

Holding a full rip. If you push a blinker, Penjamin slaps you with **Nausea**.
