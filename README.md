# Penjamin Mod (Forge 1.20.1)

Penjamin is a vibe mod that adds a clean, rip-ready pen to your world. Rips give status effects, and a full blinker hits you with **Nausea**. All about the vibeâ€”just the pen, the feel, and the consequences.

## Features

- **Penjamin** â€” a compact, rip-ready gadget.
- **Battery system** â€” one charge lasts **~40 rips**; rechargeable by **right-clicking a Redstone Block**.
- **Carts** â€” craft an **Empty Cart**, then **infuse** it with extracts (see below). Each cart lasts **~20 rips**.
- **Effects on rip** â€” different effects depending on what youâ€™re running.
- **Blinker penalty** â€” push a full blinker and youâ€™ll get **Nausea**.

> Extracts come from the **Smokeleaf Industry** mod. Youâ€™ll infuse those into Penjamin carts via a brewing stand.
